# Awesome Computer Vision
I'm taking a Computer Vision class, which is a great opportunity for me to grisp a wide range of computer vision algorithms and code about them. This journey is amazing, and I found computer vision is so cool! Here is why:
* You know convolution much better if you try out different kernels that can either do image smoothing/filtering or detect edges. 
* You would refresh and redefine your understanding of Linear Algebra if you try to understand how corner detection works. What is the exact meaning of eigen vectors/values? What is the relation of image translation to matrix transformation? I'm so thrilled to find out that computer vision is a tool to visualize the Linear Algebra concepts! By the way, I'm watching [3Blue1Brown's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) YouTube Channel along the side. 

Note: [Jupyter NBviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) linkes is used to view `.ipynb` file given that Github constantly run into rendering issues.
